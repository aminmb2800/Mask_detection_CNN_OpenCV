# Mask_detection_CNN_OpenCV

This project is a mask detection convolutional neural network (CNN) implemented with OpenCV, a popular computer vision library. The CNN is trained to detect whether a person is wearing a mask or not in real-time using a camera feed.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, you will need to clone the repository and install the necessary libraries.

### Prerequisites

* Python 3
* OpenCV 4.0 or higher
* TensorFlow 2.0 or higher
* Keras 2.3 or higher
* NumPy 1.18 or higher
* Matplotlib 3.2 or higher

### Installing
The goal is to create a Deep Learning model to detect in real-time whether a person is wearing a face mask or not using CNN and OpenCV
