# Mask_detection_CNN_OpenCV

This project is a mask detection convolutional neural network (CNN) implemented with OpenCV, a popular computer vision library. The CNN is trained to detect whether a person is wearing a mask or not in real-time using a camera feed.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, you will need to clone the repository and install the necessary libraries.

### Prerequisites

* Python 3
* OpenCV 4.0 or higher
* TensorFlow 2.0 or higher
* Keras 2.3 or higher
* NumPy 1.18 or higher
* Matplotlib 3.2 or higher

### Installing

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```
git clone https://github.com/aminmb2800/Mask_detection_CNN_OpenCV.git
```
2. Install the required libraries using pip:

```
pip install opencv-python tensorflow keras numpy matplotlib
```
## Dataset 

The model is trained on the [Mask Detection Dataset](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Eru9OyBdY5FDRegYcuZoEgR5pKCLPYfa?usp=sharing), which contains over 1376 images of people wearing masks and not wearing masks. The dataset is split into training and testing sets, with 80% of the images used for training and 20% for testing.


### Usage

To use the mask detection CNN, run the Face_mask_detection_CNN_OpenCV.ipynb script:

The goal is to create a Deep Learning model to detect in real-time whether a person is wearing a face mask or not using CNN and OpenCV
